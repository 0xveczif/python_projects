### Reverse Backdoor
This is a program that will work as reverse backdoor, we deliver it to target system and run it in tgarget system, parallely we listen on the same port and we get access to target remote system.  

There are 2 programs created  
1. Backdoor  
2. Listener  

Commands  
> sudo python2 backdoor.py  
> sudo python2 listener.py

Steps - 
1. Update IPs in script to IP of our system - ifconfig  
example - our system IP - 10.0.2.16, and we are listening on it,  
update ip to 10.0.2.16 to both files.  

2. If we want to run it persistently, without noticing to target,  
uncomment persistent function calling constructor in backdoor.py  

3. Uncomment  execute a PDF file if bundled section when packaging for any system. in backdoor.py  

Note: Only step 1 is mendatory to run the file smoothly, other 2 steps are not required to update.  

We can use normal listener netcat command to listen also, just mention correct port
> nc -vv -l -p 4444
